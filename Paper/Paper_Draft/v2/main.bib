@article{Carrasquilla2019,
	abstract = {A major bottleneck in the development of scalable many-body quantum technologies is the difficulty in benchmarking state preparations, which suffer from an exponential `curse of dimensionality'inherent to the classical description of quantum states. We present an experimentally friendly method for density matrix reconstruction based on neural network generative models. The learning procedure comes with a built-in approximate certificate of the reconstruction and makes no assumptions about the purity of the state under scrutiny. It can efficiently handle a broad class of complex systems including prototypical states in quantum information, as well as ground states of local spin models common to condensed matter physics. The key insight is to reduce state tomography to an unsupervised learning problem of the statistics of an informationally complete quantum measurement. This constitutes a modern machine learning approach to the validation of complex quantum devices, which may in addition prove relevant as a neural-network ansatz over mixed states suitable for variational optimization.},

@article{Rocchetto2018,
	abstract = {The exact description of many-body quantum systems represents one of the major challenges in modern physics, because it requires an amount of computational resources that scales exponentially with the size of the system. Simulating the evolution of a state, or even storing its description, rapidly becomes intractable for exact classical algorithms. Recently, machine learning techniques, in the form of restricted Boltzmann machines, have been proposed as a way to efficiently represent certain quantum states with applications in state tomography and ground state estimation. Here, we introduce a practically usable deep architecture for representing and sampling from probability distributions of quantum states. Our representation is based on variational auto-encoders, a type of generative model in the form of a neural network. We show that this model is able to learn efficient representations of states that are easy to simulate classically and can compress states that are not classically tractable. Specifically, we consider the learnability of a class of quantum states introduced by Fefferman and Umans. Such states are provably hard to sample for classical computers, but not for quantum ones, under plausible computational complexity assumptions. The good level of compression achieved for hard states suggests these methods can be suitable for characterizing states of the size expected in first generation quantum hardware.},

It has been realized in systems with few components, but for larger systems it becomes unfeasible because the number of measurements and the amount of computation required to process them grows exponentially in the system size. Here, we present two tomography schemes that scale much more favourably than direct tomography with system size. One of them requires unitary operations on a constant number of subsystems, whereas the other requires only local measurements together with more elaborate post-processing. Both rely only on a linear number of experimental operations and post-processing that is polynomial in the system size. These schemes can be applied to a wide range of quantum states, in particular those that are well approximated by matrix product states. The accuracy of the reconstructed states can be rigorously certified without any a priori assumptions.},
