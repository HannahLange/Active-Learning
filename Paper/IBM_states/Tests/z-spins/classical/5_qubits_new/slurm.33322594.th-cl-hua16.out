Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/user/23375/matplotlib-hz5awnmz because the default path (/project/theorie/h/Hannah.Lange/.cache/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Matplotlib is building the font cache; this may take a moment.
